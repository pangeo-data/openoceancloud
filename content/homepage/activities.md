The U.S. Ocean Decade [Launch Meeting](https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/02-02-2021/ocean-decade-us-launch-meeting) consisted of a 2-day virtual meeting.
OpenOceanCloud was proposed as an [Ocean Shot Concept](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/us-national-committee-on-ocean-science-for-sustainable-development-2021-2030#sl-three-columns-e33ae106-08bc-49e3-8baf-078797861e38), defined as
> an ambitious, transformational research concept that draws inspiration and expertise from multiple disciplines and fundamentally advances ocean science for sustainable development.

A record of our participation can be found in the [Ocean Shot Directory](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/us-national-committee-on-ocean-science-for-sustainable-development-2021-2030/ocean-shot-directory) (search for "OceanCloud").
